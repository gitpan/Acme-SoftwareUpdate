NAME
    Acme::SoftwareUpdate - check for newer version of caller module

SYNOPSIS
      package Your::Package;

      &Acme::SoftwareUpdate if eval{require Acme::SoftwareUpdate};

DESCRIPTION
    When incorported into your distribution's main module,
    Acme::SoftwareUpdate will inform your users if there is a later version
    of your distribution on the CPAN. If the user has ExtUtils::AutoInstall
    installed, Acme::SoftwareUpdate will not just inform them of the newer
    version, it will also give them the option of auto-installing the new
    version of your distribution.

    This distribution is in the Acme:: namespace for a reason. Namely, the
    author is not particularly confident that this very concept is either
    sane, or particularly useful.

CAVEATS
    Acme::SoftwareUpdate won't work with distributions whose main module
    package name differs from the distribution's name, e.g.,
    LWP/libwww-perl.

    Acme::SoftwareUpdate depends on a net connection, and the availability
    of search.cpan.org. This means that it may take up to six hours after a
    new distribution is uploaded to PAUSE for Acme::SoftwareUpdate to know
    about it.

NOTES
    If the environmental variable 'NOSOFTWAREUPDATE' is set,
    Acme::SoftwareUpdate will simply return, without doing anything.

    We use the unconventional '&Acme::SoftwareUpdate if eval{require
    Acme::SoftwareUpdate};' syntax so that an update check will be skipped
    if a user of your distribution doesn't happen to have
    Acme::SoftwareUpdate installed.
